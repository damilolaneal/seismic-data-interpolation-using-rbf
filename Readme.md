# Seismic Data Interpolation using Radial Basis Function
Okay, so here's what you have to do to replicate the results:

1- Download the code as a zipped folder. <br />
2- Unzip the folder and dump the contents into google drive(Important) so that you have an RBF folder in your main drive directory. <br />
3- Open the 562_scratch_book.ipynb file in google colab and run the notebook cell by cell. <br />

Thank you!
